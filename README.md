# Lyra Exporter Documentation

[**阅读中文文档**](https://github.com/Yalums/lyra-exporter/blob/main/README_zh.md)

**A personal project co-created with Claude.** This is a user-friendly, feature-rich tool designed to help you manage and export conversations from AI platforms. Filter through hundreds of conversations to find exactly what you need—from images and thinking processes to attachments, Artifacts, and tool call details.

## Features

- **Conversation Management**: Load multiple conversation JSON files from Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, NotebookLM, and Google AI Studio. **Supports exporting entire Claude, ChatGPT account data for comprehensive management**, supports batch loading entire folders
- **Smart Search**: Search message content, find conversations with image attachments, thinking processes, and Artifacts, supports semantic search (requires embedding model)
- **Tagging System**: Mark messages as completed, important, or deleted, with format preservation during export
- **Flexible Export**: Export to Markdown, PDF (with LaTeX formulas and images), and long screenshot formats, supports batch export and batch export of latest branches
- **Branch Detection**: Automatically detect and visualize conversation branches, supports Gemini, Grok, and SillyTavern multi-branch parsing, one-click jump to latest branch
- **Rich Content Parsing**: Intelligently recognize image attachments, thinking processes, and Markdown syntax
- **Mobile Optimization**: Hide navigation bar on scroll down, support back operations, mobile-specific global search interface



## 🔌 Lyra Exporter Fetch Companion Script

Lyra Exporter relies on browsers to safely obtain conversation data. With this open-source script, transfer chat records worth treasuring

1. Install the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) browser extension
2. Install Lyra Exporter Fetch script from [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/539579-lyra-s-exporter-fetch)
3. Visit [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai/), [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com), [Grok](https://x.com/i/grok), [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/), or [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/)
4. Click the export button on the page (enable the "Real-time" option in the companion script to use multi-branch parsing)
5. Choose export options (single conversation / full account)
6. Data is automatically sent to Lyra Exporter or downloaded locally

## Recommended Workflow

Rather than building a complex local search engine, here's my practical approach: (just for reference, be care for your personal data)

1. Use Lyra Exporter to export conversations
2. Identify 3-5 related conversations worth organizing
3. Feed them to NotebookLM for analysis and synthesis
4. Archive refined insights in Obsidian

Fast, nearly free, and gets the job done.
